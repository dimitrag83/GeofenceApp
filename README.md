# GeofenceApp
Android application diplaying Geofencing

A geofence is a virtual perimeter set on a real geographic area. Combining a user position with a geofence perimeter, it is possible to know if the user is inside or outside the geofence or even if he is exiting or entering the area.

The application will receive the current location (coordinates) from Google. 

It will then display a Google map along with Geofencing with a four (4) hour duration. 

Geofencing should be the center of the entrance to New Metro Station of the metro in Athens and 200 meters radius. 
If the current location is within the map area covered by the Geofencing, then Geofencing should disappear from the screen.
